Description: Given a matrix of coordinates as input, SamSPECTRAL first builds the communities to sample the data points. Then, it builds a graph and after weighting the edges of the graph by conductance computation, it is passed to a classic spectral clustering algorithm to find the spectral clusters. The last stage of SamSPECTRAL is to combine the spectral clusters. The resulting "connected components" estimate biological cell populations in the data sample.
